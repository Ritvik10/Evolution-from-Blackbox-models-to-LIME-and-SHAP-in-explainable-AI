# Evolution-from-Blackbox-models-to-LIME-and-SHAP-in-explainable-AI

Using SHAP values for finding the best variables for a medical fraud classifier model, this code was reported in this article

Libraries: In this project, we used pandas, numpy, sklearn, catboost, shap, random, itertools, seaborn and matplotlib

Files:

Medical_Fraud.ipynb: This holds the notebook used for cleaning the data and training the model

data.rar: rar file with the input datasets for the model, this must be unpacked first before running the code

Summary of findings: We discovered that SHAP values were very useful for finding good variables for a logistic model, giving high scores in recall and in accuracy
